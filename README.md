# PROGRAMMING-BASICS
A step by step detail guide to programming basics with python.


> Computer programming is an act of writing a step by step action to perform
   action by computer machine

** *This guide is an attempt to give roadmap to learn computer programming basics with practical approach learn at your pace* **


__Note__: *No prerequisites require to learn from this guide, execpt a computer/laptop. Beginners-Friendly :)*

## INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER PROGRAM
before getting into complete explanation, let's first understand a computer program
> *computer program is a sequence of steps/instruction written in machine language to perfrom an action by a machine*

Two important thing to note:
* Sequence of instruction &
* machine/progamming language

understand this like, if someone ask you a way to school.

1. Go straight
2. Drive half a kilometer
3. take left
4. Drive one kilometer more
5. search for school at your left side

The above sequence of instructions is actually a Human action statements written in English Language, which instructs on how to reach school from a given starting point. This same sequence could have been given in Russian, Hindi, Urdu, or any other human language, provided the person seeking direction knows any of these languages.


Now, try to map the situation with a computer program which is a sequence of instructions written in a Computer Language to perform a specified task by the computer.

```
print("Hello, world!")
```

The above computer program instructs the computer to print __Hello, World!__ on the computer screen.

## ALGORITHM

From programming point of view, an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to resolve any problem. An algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite set of well-defined instructions.

Thus, a computer programmer lists down all the steps required to resolve a problem before writing the actual code.

-sum of N numbers
-fibonacci series
-factorial of Nth number 

## PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT

__Environment__ is actually a first setp to setup before writing our program, though __Environment__ Setup is not an element of any programming language but it simply implies a base on top of which we can do our programming.

To kick start your programming journey you need below tools:
* A Text editor like Notepad on windows OS
* A compiler to compile program into binary format
* An iterpretor to execute program directly

### Text Editor
